- Follow PEP 8 style guide for formatting.
- Use docstrings to document functions and classes.
- Write simple and clear code; avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Prefer list comprehensions for creating lists when appropriate.
- Use try-except blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.
- Utilize type hints for better code clarity and type checking.
- Limit the use of global variables to reduce side effects.

- Choose descriptive variable, function, and class names.
type hints相当重要，你可以创建配置类而不是直接使用Dict[str, Any]
