<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Gathering task details**

I need to read three files in parallel to collect tasks. I should use the read_file tool for each one and also look for any TODO sections. First, though, I’ll read the content and provide a status update before making those tool calls. After reading, I’ll parse the tasks and figure out what “continue completing later features” means for the project. Since it’s a Nuxt frontend, I’ll ensure I know which features to implement. Let’s move forward with the plan!</details></think>

---

I'll review the provided context files to identify the remaining features and next steps, then proceed to implement them.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Assessing user request**

The user has provided a Chinese message asking me to read an attached MD file carefully and continue completing certain features. I've already read three MD files containing a conversation transcript with to-dos and code edits. However, I realize that the changes highlighted in the transcript may not have been applied to the codebase yet. I'll need to check the current code state, verify what exists, and implement any missing features as requested by the user.
**Confirming code before changes**

I need to confirm the installed code before making any changes, following the developer tool usage rules. For multi-step tasks, I’ll use todo_write. Here’s what I plan to implement: First, I'll check if the API types extension for the Workshop exists in app/types/api.ts. Next, I’ll update the Pinia workshops store for CRUD in app/stores/workshops.ts and verify the existence and properties of components like GenericWorkshop.vue, InformationAlchemy, and FallbackWorkshop. Finally, I’ll assess the UI pages and check on the Sidebar settings button issue in app/components/layout/Sidebar.vue.
**Ensuring sidebar functionality**

I need to confirm that the "sidebar active" feature highlights only one item based on the exact root path rule, so I’ll check and update the isActive logic accordingly. Then, I must implement WebSocket functionality for the GenericWorkshop or at least set up a RESTful solution to execute tasks while maintaining formatting and indentation guidelines. I’ll use read_file to access several relevant files, including Sidebar.vue and various components in the workshops directory, as well as check for the fetchCollections method in stores/collections.ts. Lastly, I’ll verify path alias usage and ensure proper configuration in nuxt.config.ts.
**Opening files in parallel**

I’m planning to open several files in parallel, focusing on ensuring the correct usage of UI components, specifically checking for PascalCase versus named imports. I'm guessing they probably use component registration through auto-import, and many '.index.ts' files provide relevant names. I need to confirm the usage of the "Button" component: should I import it explicitly, or is it covered by global registration in Nuxt? I'll check the existing code in pages to see how these components are used, and I’ll use multi_tool_use.parallel for reading the multiple files.</details></think>

---

I'll scan the current frontend files to see what is already implemented versus what's still pending (Sidebar active state, settings link, workshops CRUD, dynamic route, GenericWorkshop, API types/store). Then I'll implement the remaining features accordingly.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing workshop features**

I need to provide a selection of favorite items in GenericWorkshop.vue. I’m thinking about adding a `selectedItemId` state to handle item selection, possibly highlighting the selected card. I’ll include a 'Run/Execute' button that will call the necessary store function and manage task status and results. On mount, I’ll need to ensure that `fetchCollections()` is present in the collections store. I'll check the relevant file to confirm its existence.</details></think>

---

I'll look at the collections store to ensure we can fetch items and then implement run/stream logic in `GenericWorkshop.vue`, plus wire up execute and result view.

---

Read file: undefined

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Reviewing UI and Type Definitions**

I'm focusing on adding a UI that shows the currently selected item and run controls, displayed in the right panel. I think I need to ensure that 'collectionsStore.fetchCollections()' is called on mount to populate items, perhaps with single selection. I also need to update 'types/api.ts' to make sure 'Task.result' is defined correctly. There are required fields missing that may lead to TypeScript errors. I should verify why it might compile successfully despite these issues.
**Adjusting Task Type Definitions**

I'm noticing that the 'api.ts' store file uses the 'Task' interface, and it sets 'task.result = { content: '' }', which might be a linter error. I think it would be better to adjust the types so that 'task.result' could be 'Result | { content: string }' or perhaps define a new 'TaskStreamResult' type. It makes sense to extend 'Task' to include a string for 'partial result content' instead of directly assigning to 'Result,' which should only be created upon success. I should also check the 'workshops.ts' store file for potential type mismatches.
**Inspecting Code for Task References**

I’m considering that changing 'types/api' should minimally affect the rest of the code. To ensure everything’s in order, I'll inspect other parts of the code that reference 'Task.result.' It seems like searching across the workspace using grep would give me the direct hits I need. While the guidelines suggest using codebase_search for semantic queries, searching for the exact symbol 'result' makes more sense here. I should also look for how 'Task' or 'tasks' are used in the UI.</details></think>

---

I'll search for references to Task.result or tasks usage to ensure type compatibility and decide where to surface streaming content.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating components and fixing errors**

I think I need to update the `app/pages/workshops.vue` file to ensure it passes `editingWorkshop` properly. I also need to double-check the dropdown menu component names since it uses `DropdownMenuContent`. 

Then there's the issue with the `app/pages/collections/[id].vue`: it’s calling `collectionsStore.fetchCollectionById()`, but I have to verify if this action exists in the store. If not, that points to a bug, since it seems we need to create it in `collections.ts`. 

Also, I should check the `workshopsStore.fetchWorkshops()` to ensure it uses the correct endpoint. There’s mention of needing mappings for components, particularly regarding `PointCounterpoint`. Should I add that mapping too?
**Enhancing component mappings and implementations**

I need to add to the component mapping by including 'point-counterpoint' and possibly setting a fallback to either `FallbackWorkshop` or `Generic`. 

For the `GenericWorkshop`, I want to implement a selection feature for items, improving the UI to allow for single or multiple selections. The `executeWorkshop` store function currently uses only one item ID, but we should enable it to work with selections from the list. 

Next, the "ai 工坊 manage page" needs to use the correct endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting workshops while ensuring the API returns JSON data. 

Lastly, I should confirm that `pages/workshops/[id].vue` correctly passes the actual workshop object, rather than a reference. In Vue 3, I’m wondering if passing a computed ref will effectively send the value as intended.
**Implementing various workshop components**

I realize that in templates, refs are automatically unwrapped, so I need to keep that in mind for prop values.

The `WorkshopConfigForm.vue` file has already been created, which is great. I might also need to check for the existence of the `Textarea.vue` component. 

I've completed the import for dropdown-menu components, and now I should look at the `app/pages/workshops.vue`, where the "line-clamp" class is used—I'll confirm if the Tailwind plugin is required. 

I see that `GenericWorkshop.vue` imports `ScrollArea` and `CardHeader`, but it seems CardHeader isn't used. The linter might not flag unused imports, but I'm thinking it's okay to leave it as is.

I also want to add a subscription to tasks and display results directly in `GenericWorkshop`, rather than on a separate page. I'll implement an "execute" button to show results using the tasks store. 

Additionally, I plan to include a selection of `collectionsStore.items`. But if those items aren't loaded, we should ensure they are fetched. I've added a refresh button, but I think I should call `fetchCollections` on mount so the list isn't empty. I'll use `onMounted` to make sure the store has items ready.
**Ensuring component functionality and updates**

I noticed there's no direct `onMounted` imported, so it's essential to import and call it when necessary.

In `app/pages/workshops/[id].vue`, I need to ensure the computed properties use the store correctly. If the store hasn't loaded the list yet—like when navigating directly to `/workshops/ID`—the `getWorkshopById` could return undefined. I should add an `onMounted` check to fetch the list if it's empty. Otherwise, the template might show "加载中..." indefinitely for an unloaded workshop.

I think the `workshops.manage` endpoint will likely require '/workshops/manage,' which is good to note. 

As for adding a `FallbackWorkshop` mapping, that might not be necessary, and in `app/pages/workshops.vue`, updating imports for icons for kebab is also not needed since it uses '···' instead.

Now I'll look into dynamic mapping by type as mentioned in the documentation. Finally, I want to update `app/components/workshops/InformationAlchemy.vue` to accept 'workshop' as a prop, moving away from the 'workshop-info' used previously. I'll read through `InformationAlchemy.vue` and `PointCounterpoint.vue` in the repository for reference.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Identifying a critical bug**

I’ve realized that the dynamic route is passing a prop named `workshop` instead of `workshopInfo`. In `workshops/[id].vue`, it uses `<component :is="DynamicComponent" :workshop="workshop" />`, which causes specialized components expecting `workshopInfo` to fail. That's a significant bug! I think I should update `InformationAlchemy.vue` to accept `workshop` instead or adjust the mapping loader to wrap it. This seems simpler. Also, I need to check `PointCounterpoint.vue` since it probably expects `workshopInfo` too.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating GenericWorkshop Improvements**

The md file suggests that we need to finalize the "执行 → WebSocket → 结果展示" functionality in the GenericWorkshop. Right now, there's no execute button present, just a "保存" option and a placeholder for results after executing a task. Additionally, we need to ensure that the executeWorkshop supports an optional payload, as it currently only accepts the itemId. There’s inconsistency observed between the PointCounterpoint component and the store definition, which could lead to errors. I'll need to adjust the executeWorkshop method to accept those extra parameters.
**Clarifying Workshop Functionality**

So, I've noticed that `fetchWorkshops` is using GET '/workshops/manage' instead of the previously expected '/workshops'. I’ll check if this change is intended. The backend path might actually be '/workshops/manage', which is fine as long as it’s working. We also need to implement the GenericWorkshop run and streaming features. This includes adding the ability to select a FavoriteItem and clicking "执行" to run the task while showing streaming results. Additionally, I need to manage the active task ID and ensure collections are prefetched on mount. Finally, I need to verify that the workshop dynamic route passes the 'workshop' prop correctly.
**Reviewing Workshop Component Setup**

I've realized that in template evaluation, 'workshop' is holding a reactive computed value. At runtime, that means it's passing a computed ref object. In the Composition API, 'workshop' is indeed a ref using computed(() => ...). Vue's template automatically unwraps refs, so using :workshop="workshop" is perfectly fine. Now I need to verify that GenericWorkshop.vue's props are defined as Workshop. Since the CRUD operations for the workshops manage page are set up, I’ve noted that fetchWorkshops uses '/workshops/manage', while other operations use different endpoints. Lastly, I ensured type names for 'Workshop' include 'max_tokens', 'system_prompt', and 'user_prompt_template', updating them to match the usage in both GenericWorkshop and WorkshopConfigForm.
**Implementing Settings and Component Features**

I need to confirm that 'app/pages/settings.vue' is present for the settings route, and it checks out with the project layout. Next, we should add specialized pages and components mapping as noted in the documentation. While we have InformationAlchemy.vue and PointCounterpoint.vue, the current mapping only includes 'information-alchemy', and I should add 'point-counterpoint' for the component loader. 

I see that 'FallbackWorkshop.vue' is correctly listed in the project layout. For our dynamic route fallback, we need to ensure we map 'point-counterpoint' now. Lastly, I'll make sure the 'workshopsStore.executeWorkshop' WebSocket path is set correctly. I need to update GenericWorkshop for selection and execution since it currently lists items but lacks a click selection function.
**Implementing Workshop Enhancements**

I need to enable item selection in GenericWorkshop, updating it to call store.executeWorkshop with content ID parameters while subscribing to tasks. The streaming results should append messages to tasks[taskId].result.content. It’s crucial to ensure dynamic routing passes both 'workshop' and 'workshop-info' props to avoid issues with InformationAlchemy.vue and PointCounterpoint.vue. 

I'll modify store.executeWorkshop to accept an extra payload for prompts and ensure the user experience is smooth with selectable item cards and clear execution buttons. 

Additionally, I'll check the collections store for any missing functions and avoid unnecessary changes. I'll proceed to implement these updates efficiently using the apply_patch tool.
**Planning Code Updates**

I need to follow the apply_patch tool for our updates to streamline code changes properly. The first step is to update the `executeWorkshop` function signature and add a payload for extra parameters. I'll also ensure that `PointCounterpoint.vue` and `InformationAlchemy.vue` properly use the `workshopInfo.id` instead of passing string constants. 

Next, I'll set up the `GenericWorkshop` to track selected items and initiate tasks effectively. I’ll also add a dynamic route that passes both the `workshop` and `workshop-info`. Following that, I'll check for lint errors in modified files and create a todo list for our multi-step tasks to track progress.
**Organizing Task Updates**

I'm going to create four tasks using `functions.todo_write` and set the first one as in progress. Then, I’ll proceed with code edits across several files with `apply_patch`. 

Starting with `app/stores/workshops.ts`, I’ll update the `executeWorkshop` function to accept an extra payload. Next, I’ll adjust the component mappings and modify the template in `app/pages/workshops/[id].vue` to pass both `workshop` and `workshop-info`. 

Then, in `GenericWorkshop.vue`, I’ll implement state tracking and ensure imports align properly. I'll run a linter check after each patch to catch potential issues.</details></think>

---

I'll implement the remaining workshop features: enhance GenericWorkshop with execute and streaming, fix specialized components to use the correct workshop ID, expand component mapping, and update the dynamic route to pass props compatible with all components. Then I'll run a lint check on the changed files.

I’m going to update the dynamic workshops route to pass both `workshop` and `workshopInfo` props so existing specialized components continue to work, and then adjust the store’s execute method to allow extra payload (for cases like PointCounterpoint). I'll make these edits now.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing workshop execution**

I need to implement selection and run "executeWorkshop" with the selected item, then show the streaming result in the right column as part of our to-do list. We updated pages/workshops/[id].vue to pass both workshop and workshop-info. There's a point of confusion: the store workshops.ts. It fetches from '/workshops/manage' instead of the specified '/workshops'. We also need to confirm that the backend supports these endpoints and adapt the executeWorkshop function to handle extra payloads for specialized workshops.
**Fixing workshop execution ids**

Okay, our dynamic route is now correctly passing both the workshop and other details. However, in InformationAlchemy.vue, the handleExecute function currently calls `executeWorkshop` with the 'type' string instead of the actual workshop ID. The request is pointing to an invalid endpoint, which should be referencing the workshop ID instead. I need to adjust that to use the correct ID. Similarly, PointCounterpoint.vue has the same issue. I also need to make sure that executeWorkshop accepts an optional payload for extra parameters and add mapping for the specialized components.
**Updating workshop execution**

I see we're falling back to 'generic' via the componentMap, which is fine. Here are the tasks ahead: I need to extend `executeWorkshop` to accept a third optional argument for an 'extra' payload and to handle optional or negative item IDs. I'll restructure it in the store to compile the body object accordingly.

Next, I must update all call sites — in pages/collections/[id].vue, that looks good. For InformationAlchemy.vue, I'll switch to use `workshopInfo.id` and `selectedCollection.value.id`. In PointCounterpoint.vue, it'll change to `executeWorkshop(workshopInfo.id, undefined, { prompt: coreArgumentText.value })`. Lastly, I'll implement GenericWorkshop to select a FavoriteItem and show streaming results in the right panel.
**Updating collections and routes**

I'm adding a `selectedItem` ref for the initial fetch of collections and computing the results from tasks. However, I noticed that the collections store lacks the `fetchCollectionById` method, which is referenced in pages/collections/[id].vue. This raises questions because that page refers to `collectionsStore.activeItem`, but that field doesn't exist. It seems like that might be a leftover or broken functionality, but since it’s not part of our current focus on workshops, I’ll set it aside for now.

Next, I need to add mapping for 'point-counterpoint' in the store's componentMap. There's also an issue with the dynamic route using a computed `workshop` that utilizes `getWorkshopById`; if a user navigates to '/workshops/:id' without triggering `fetchWorkshops`, the `workshop` may be undefined. I should consider calling `fetchWorkshops` if it's not already loaded.
**Enhancing workshop functionality**

I’m noticing that earlier, there was an `onMounted` fetch in the MD documentation for when `store.workshops` length is zero. It could be beneficial to add that for robustness, ensuring direct links still work. I will also ensure the API list page uses the correct endpoint for `/workshops/manage`.

Next, I want to add a 'run' button in GenericWorkshop. This will use `selectedItemId` when clicking on the card list, allowing for styled selection highlights. I'll have an 'execute' button calling `stores.executeWorkshop(props.workshop.id, selectedItemId)` to display results in a UI with status messages. 

Additionally, I’ll include `onMounted(() => collectionsStore.fetchCollections())` and check `fetchWorkshops` on mount if the list is empty. After making these edits, I'll run `read_lints` to catch any TypeScript errors and ensure everything is correctly imported. Let's get to editing the `app/stores/workshops.ts` file!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing feature updates**

I think we can fix that bug as part of finishing our features, but we might want to mark it for later since there's an ongoing request. We should create store functions and update our `collections.ts` file to include actions for `activeItem` and a method to fetch collections by ID. It's important to address the broken page identified in the `pages/collections/[id].vue` file that relies on the favorites endpoint. I have to remember not to output code directly to the user, and use code edit tools instead. Let's update things stepwise.
**Updating the GenericWorkshop component**

To prevent concurrency issues with referencing workshops, I’ll implement a patch. First, I need to update `GenericWorkshop.vue` by adding the `onMounted` import and defining a `selectedItemId` reference. I also want to add a handler for executing tasks and styling for selected items while displaying results. We’ll compute tasks from the store and create a `currentTaskId` reference. This involves importing `workshopsStore.tasks`, and ensuring that I read from the tasks map. Then, I’ll add the `execute` function for handling task execution and set it to update `currentTaskId`. Finally, I'll set up a mounted call to fetch collections.
**Updating InformationAlchemy and PointCounterpoint components**

I'm going to update `InformationAlchemy.vue` by modifying the props type to accept either `workshopInfo` or `workshop`, ensuring it can handle the dynamic route passing a `workshop-info` attribute. I'll make sure to update the `handleExecute` function to use `workshopInfo.id`. 

Next, for `PointCounterpoint.vue`, I’ll use `workshopInfo.id` and set `itemId` to undefined. I’ll update store mappings to include `point-counterpoint`. Then, I’ll adjust the collections store to add `activeItem` and create the action `fetchCollectionById` to retrieve data as per the RESTful conventions. After that, I’ll run lint checks on the modified files to catch any errors.</details></think>

---

I'll update the dynamic route to ensure workshops are loaded when navigating directly, enhance GenericWorkshop to support selecting a collection, executing the workshop, and streaming the result, adjust specialized components to use the correct workshop ID, and add missing collections store methods used by the collections detail page. Then I'll run a lint check on the modified files.

- I reviewed your attached MD context and continued the AI Workshops implementation.

- Status: I updated the dynamic route to pass compatible props, extended the store to support extra payloads for execution, completed GenericWorkshop’s execute-and-stream flow, and fixed specialized components to use the correct workshop ID. No linter errors.

- Next, I'll wait for you to test the end-to-end flow and let me know any tweaks.

Summary of changes:
- `app/pages/workshops/[id].vue`: Loads workshops if opened directly; passes both `workshop` and `workshop-info` props for backward compatibility.
- `app/stores/workshops.ts`:
  - Added `point-counterpoint` to `componentMap`.
  - `executeWorkshop` now accepts optional `itemId` and `extraPayload`, constructs body accordingly.
- `app/components/workshops/GenericWorkshop.vue`:
  - Added selection of collection item, execute button, streaming result display.
  - Loads collections on mount if empty.
- `app/components/workshops/InformationAlchemy.vue` and `PointCounterpoint.vue`:
  - Now use the actual workshop’s `id` for execution, and accept either `workshop` or `workshopInfo`.

All TODOs for this phase are completed.
