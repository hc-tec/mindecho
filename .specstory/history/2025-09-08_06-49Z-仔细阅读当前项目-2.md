仔细阅读当前项目
项目中存在一系列问题，请你帮我改进
1. 用户的配置（目前我只需要服务一个用户）保存在内存中，而不是数据库或者文件中，重启项目就会丢失，你需要改进
2. workshop执行的任务一般来说是AI大模型任务，在前端应该可以自由配置提示词的，你需要实现这个功能，并在当前项目各处调用任务实现的过程中修改逻辑

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Modifying the codebase**

I need to modify the codebase with two main tasks: first, to persist the user configuration instead of keeping it in memory, and second, to implement workshop tasks that allow for a configurable front-end prompt and change the logic regarding executed tasks. I need to explore the existing code to see how configurations are currently handled and check out the workshop service and its endpoints. Creating a to-do list would help, and I’ll look into parallel searches for configuration management.</details></think>

---

I'll first scan the codebase to locate where user settings are currently stored in memory and how workshops/tasks are executed so I can plan the persistence and prompt customization changes. Then I'll create a task list and begin implementing persistence and prompt support end-to-end.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating settings persistence**

I've discovered the settings endpoint with in-memory app settings and runtime configuration for the category map. Now, I need to think about persisting the user configuration to a database or file. Using SQLite seems like the easiest option. Should I create a Settings model for this? There’s a db/models.py file that I need to look at to see the existing models, so I’ll open that file and check it out.</details></think>

---

I'll open the database models and any runtime config utilities to design a persistent settings storage, and inspect the workshop service to add prompt customization support end-to-end.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing settings persistence**

I need to think about how to implement persistent settings for a single user instead of just in-memory storage. The project already uses SQLite and SQLAlchemy models, but there's currently no Settings model. I'll create a `UserSetting` table to store preferences like theme, notifications, and AI model. Since it's a single user, a single row with an ID of 1 might work. Alternatively, I could just keep things simple and store settings in a JSON file. I'll also need to consider migrations and check the `backend/app/db/base.py` for any existing setup.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing settings persistence**

I need to implement persistence for settings and the category map, which are currently in API endpoint and in-memory runtime configuration. I'll set up a Settings or KeyValue table for a single user, using id=1 to store items like theme, notification settings, AI model, and a JSON for category-to-workshop as well as prompts for customization. 

Next, I’ll also work on allowing prompt configuration through the backend, so I’ll update the workshops endpoint to handle prompt requests and adjust the workshop service accordingly.
**Adding user settings and modifications**

I need to create a new UserSetting model with fields like id, theme, notifications_enabled, ai_model, category_to_workshop in JSON format, and workshop_prompts as a dictionary of workshop_id to prompt templates. Keeping it simpler, I can just use JSON within the settings.

Also, I’ll add a Task.prompt field that’s nullable to take custom prompts during execution. I should adjust the settings endpoints to read and write from the database, ensuring default row id=1 is loaded or created.

Finally, I’ll modify the workshops execute request to accept prompts, which will be stored and formatted in Task.prompt during the workshop task execution.
**Implementing settings and endpoints**

The prompt should be flexible, allowing free text input with the source concatenated at the end.

I’ll create new endpoints for GET and PUT requests related to workshop prompts, which may be integrated into the settings model.

Also, I want to update the main startup process to load task mappings from the database instead of runtime_config. I’ll implement a settings_service for getting and updating settings.

I need to add a new AppSetting class in `backend/app/db/models.py` with necessary fields and consider migration. I should check table creation during startup in `backend/app/main.py` to make sure everything initializes correctly.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing user features**

I'm focusing on two key features. First, I want to persist user settings instead of just keeping them in memory. Using a database seems fitting since I'm already working with SQLAlchemy. I'll create a Settings table to store key-value pairs for various user preferences and ensure this data loads at startup. 

Next, I'll enable prompt customization on the frontend while keeping it backend-driven. This means I’ll adjust the workshop execution to accept custom prompts and allow default prompts to be stored and managed.
**Updating configuration settings**

I need to ensure that the runtime configuration mapping categories to workshops is persisted. My plan is to create a new model called `AppSetting` with key-value pairs stored as JSON or text. To keep it simple, I could use a primary key for the key and store the JSON in the value field instead. 

Next, I'll modify the endpoints/settings.py to read and write data via a database session. This will involve creating a Pydantic model that includes fields for category-to-workshop mapping and workshop prompts. I’ll also adjust the `run_workshop_task` to accept an optional prompt parameter and consider adding a `prompt` field to Tasks for persistence.
**Updating Task model and endpoint**

I’m planning to enhance the Task model by adding a `prompt` column as Text and potentially a `model` column as a string. The `start_workshop_task` should take optional parameters for both the prompt and the model to store relevant data. 

I’ll also modify the execute endpoint request model to accommodate these optional fields. For the startup, I’ll create a service to fetch the prompt from settings, ensuring we auto-create necessary columns in the database during startup. Lastly, I’ll ensure the client SDK remains unaffected by these changes.
**Implementing database and service updates**

I'm planning to modify the `models.py` file by adding a new class called `AppSetting` with a primary key for the key and a Text field for the value, along with introducing `prompt` and `model` columns to the Task model.

Next, I’ll create a new `settings_service.py` file with functions to manage settings while using a typed Pydantic model to avoid circular imports. 

I'll also update the `settings.py` endpoints to utilize the database dependency and define a Pydantic `Settings` model for various settings fields. For the `workshop_service.py`, I’ll adjust `start_workshop_task` to accept optional parameters for prompt and model, with logic to determine the source and build prompts accordingly.
**Implementing configurable prompts**

To give users the ability to configure prompts in the frontend, I’ll ensure we use the provided prompt, replacing any `{source}` placeholders with the actual source, or appending two newlines plus the source if it’s not there. If no prompt is available, I'll revert to default prompts from the `workshop_prompts` setting, or use previous hardcoded options if those aren’t found.

I need to call the LLM using the selected prompt and choose the model from either the task’s model or a global AI model setting. I’ll create a helper function, `load_settings_value`, for streamlined settings access.

Next, I’ll update `workshops.py` to include optional fields for the prompt and AI model in `WorkshopExecutionRequest` and ensure they’re passed to the service. Additionally, in `main.py`, I’ll load mappings from `AppSetting` into `runtime_config` during startup and track our progress with cleanup tasks through `todo_write`.</details></think>

## Todo List

- [-] Add persistent settings storage via AppSetting table and service
- [ ] Persist runtime category_to_workshop mapping and load at startup
- [ ] Enable custom prompts and model in workshop execution API
- [ ] Update workshop service to use task.prompt or saved defaults
- [ ] Wire startup auto-task handler to use default workshop prompts

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating model configuration**

I need to update the model starting with the runtime_config. On startup, it should load category_to_workshop from settings_service and maintain defaults. I also want to add a method to set values from a mapping that's already in place.

Next, after creating all, I should load the mapping through AsyncSession and update the runtime_config. I'll modify the workshops endpoint so that WorkshopExecutionRequest has an optional prompt and model. I’ll also adjust other functions to make sure they can handle these updates efficiently, including imports and batch status updates.</details></think>

---

I'll add a persistent settings model and service, update the API to use it, extend tasks with prompt/model, and adjust workshop execution to use custom prompts or saved defaults. Then I'll load the category mapping at startup.

workshop应该也是能够自由添加编辑的，比如说名字，提示词啥的都应该能够CRUD！

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing CRUD for workshops**

I need to implement CRUD functionality for workshops, which currently are static. I’ll create a DB model for Workshop, including fields like id, name, default_prompt, and description. Also, I’ll set up endpoints in workshops.py for listing, creating, updating, and deleting workshops.

Additionally, I have to modify workshop_service.run_workshop_task to use task.prompt if available; otherwise, it should use the workshop's default prompt. Persisting runtime category mapping is also essential. I'll handle the persistence for the category map as JSON in AppSetting and load it during startup. It's time to tackle this!
**Updating workshop model and endpoints**

I need to update `backend/app/db/models.py` to add a Workshop model. I’m considering a unique string ID for the workshop, alongside fields like id, workshop_id, name, default_prompt, default_model, and created_at, as well as an active flag.

Next, I’ll update the schemas for WorkshopCreate, WorkshopUpdate, and Workshop. In `endpoints/workshops.py`, I’ll create GET and POST methods for managing workshops.

For the execution endpoint, I’ll accept requests with collection_id and optional parameters. I also need to enhance `run_workshop_task` to determine the prompt based on task details or defaults.
**Updating workshop utilities and settings**

The `client_sdk` class method `chat_with_yuanbao` currently only accepts a prompt, and I’ll leave that as is for now. However, I’ll consider storing `llm_model` in the task for potential future use.

Then, I need to update the main startup to seed default workshops and load the category map from the DB using the AppSetting key `category_to_workshop` as a JSON string. I’ll also ensure that when saving settings in `settings.py`, the category map is persisted properly.

I plan to adjust the `get_available_workshops` method to read from the DB while keeping the response model compatible. Let’s get started!
**Updating and patching files**

I need to update multiple files, and I'm considering whether to use a parallel approach with `apply_patch`. However, it seems the tool design expects separate calls, so I'll follow that route.

After making edits, I want to ensure everything is linted correctly. I’ll run `read_lints` for the changed files afterward. Time to start applying those patches! I'll keep my focus on ensuring everything runs smoothly.</details></think>

---

I'll add a `Workshop` table and CRUD APIs, allow execution requests to pass custom `prompt`/`llm_model`, update the workshop service to use task or workshop defaults, and persist/load the category map in settings via `AppSetting`. Then I'll seed defaults and load the mapping at startup.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I need to address the issue with the workshops.py patch, which has partially failed. To figure out what's going on, I'll open the file and check its current content. This should give me insights into what changes were made and where things might have gone wrong. Let's dive in! I'll ensure to approach this systematically so that we can resolve the problem effectively.</details></think>

## Todo List

- [x] Add persistent settings storage via AppSetting table and service
- [x] Persist runtime category_to_workshop mapping and load at startup
- [x] Enable custom prompts and model in workshop execution API
- [x] Update workshop service to use task.prompt or saved defaults
- [x] Wire startup auto-task handler to use default workshop prompts

---

- I’ll add CRUD for workshops and wire prompts/models into execution.
- Implementing now.

- Added persistence:
  - Created `AppSetting` for durable settings; `GET/PUT /api/v1/settings` now reads/writes DB and persists `category_to_workshop` (stored as JSON).
  - Seeded and load `category_to_workshop` at startup in `backend/app/main.py`.

- Enabled customizable workshop execution:
  - Extended `Task` with `prompt` and `llm_model`; extended schemas accordingly.
  - `POST /api/v1/workshops/{workshop_id}/execute` accepts optional `prompt` and `llm_model`.

- Workshop CRUD:
  - Added `Workshop` table with `workshop_id`, `name`, `description`, `default_prompt`, `default_model`.
  - New endpoints:
    - `GET /api/v1/workshops/manage` list
    - `POST /api/v1/workshops/manage` create
    - `PUT /api/v1/workshops/manage/{workshop_id}` update
    - `DELETE /api/v1/workshops/manage/{workshop_id}` delete
  - `GET /api/v1/workshops` now returns DB-managed workshops instead of static list.
  - Startup seeds 5 defaults if empty.

- Prompt/model resolution in tasks:
  - Precedence: task override > workshop default > fallback string.
  - `{source}` placeholder replaced with the item’s title/intro.
  - If model supported by client, it’s passed through.

- No lint errors.

Summary:
- Settings are now durable across restarts.
- Workshops can be freely added/edited via CRUD, and prompts are configurable per workshop and per execution.
- All relevant endpoints and services were updated to use the new persistence and prompt logic.

run_workshop_task你应该提供一些通用性吧，万一日后任务的执行并不是调用chat_with_yuanbao呢，而是做其他的事情？

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing CRUD for Workshops**

I need to map `payload.executor_config` to a JSON string in the CRUD operations. SQLAlchemy returns text when listing, and Pydantic won't auto-parse this. Since we return ORM rows and the schema expects a dict, I’ll either set the property or convert it before returning. The easiest approach is to change the schema for `Workshop` to use `Optional[str]` for `executor_config`. 

But the user might prefer a simpler config. I’ll return parsed JSON and construct dicts in the relevant endpoints. I'll implement these changes now.</details></think>

---

I'll generalize workshop execution with a pluggable executor system. I'll add `executor_type` and `executor_config` to `Workshop`, update schemas and CRUD to handle them (JSON-serialized), seed defaults with `llm_chat`, and implement an executor registry in `services/executors.py`. Then I'll refactor `run_workshop_task` to call the appropriate executor based on the workshop configuration.

- I’ll make workshop execution pluggable so it isn’t tied to one LLM call.
- Implemented a generic executor system.

Changes:
- Workshop config
  - Added `executor_type` and `executor_config` to `Workshop`; CRUD supports them (`/api/v1/workshops/manage`).
  - Seeded defaults with `executor_type=llm_chat`.
- Executor registry
  - New `app/services/executors.py` with a simple registry and `execute_llm_chat` executor.
  - Executors receive `ExecutionContext` and return text; easy to add more types later.
- Task runner
  - `run_workshop_task` now resolves the workshop, selects executor by `executor_type`, builds prompt/model from task/workshop, and runs via the executor.
  - Still streams status updates and persists the result.

This allows future executors (e.g., data transforms, file ops) to plug in without changing `run_workshop_task`.
